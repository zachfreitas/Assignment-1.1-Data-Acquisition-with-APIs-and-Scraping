## ADS 509: Data Acquisition with APIs and Scraping

Acquiring data is one of the fundamental steps in any analysis and proficiency at APIs and web scraping unlocks rich data sets for future analyses. In this assignment you will pull data from the Twitter API and scrape lyrics from AZlyrics.com.  

Instructions: 

1. Create a repository under your GitHub account from this template: https://github.com/37chandler/ads-tm-api-scrape. Instructions can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template). Make your repository public or add your instructor’s Github account as a [collaborator](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository). 
2. Choose two musical artists for your project. Both should have at least 100,000 followers on Twitter and at least twenty songs at their artist page on AZLyrics. Those pages have forms like this: https://www.azlyrics.com/r/robyn.html. 
3. The file “API and Scrape.ipynb” holds your starting code for this assignment. 
    * In the first part of the assignment, you will pull data from Twitter. Following the provided code and the instructions in Chapter 2 of your textbook, pull the descriptions of all followers for each of your artists.
    * The second part of the file holds starting code for the second half of the assignment. Follow the instructions in that notebook, pulling and storing the lyrics for both artists.
    * The final part of the notebook holds evaluation code for the first two parts. If you’ve completed the assignment correctly, you should be able to just run this section as is. 

Note: Storing API keys in repositories is not recommended. An example .py file is posted to Blackboard. 

Assignment Materials:
* [API and Web Scraping Repository](https://github.com/37chandler/ads-tm-api-scrape)

Deliverables:
* When you have finished your code, print both of your notebooks as PDFs and upload these documents to Blackboard. 
* Commit your code and push the changes to GitHub so your instructor has access to the ipynb notebook files and any other code you create. 
* Note: this assignment is complete when you have pulled at least 100,000 followers for both of your artists.
