Double Team


[spoken] 
Damn, a hard day's rockin'. Better slip off ma shoes. 
Maybe give a little stretch, and a bend. 
Dip m'toe to jacuzzi, baby. Slip out this book: 
The Buttress of Windsor. Ho ho ho, who's this? How's it goin'? 
[sung] 
That's the first thin' I say to you. 
How's it goin'? Are you flowin'? 
Listen honey, 
Thinkin' 'bout a couple things to say to you, 
Showin', growin', 
Man I'd like to place my hand 
upon your fuckin' sexy ass and squeeze. 
And squeeze! 

Take off your blouse, 
And your underpants, 
Then take a look, 
'Cause here me and KG come naked, 
Out of the side-hatch, 
With the oils and perfume and incense. 
Now you're groovin', 
Put on a cool '70s groove. 
A funky groove to fuck to. 
A funky groove to fuck to. 

Me, me and KG, 
It's all about sex supreme, 
We likes to cream jeans. (sex)
Have you ever been worked on 
By two guys who are hot for your snatch? (sex)
That's what I'm offerin' you. 
You step into our room, 
And then you smell the perfume, 
You lay upon our roundish bed, 
And then you feel a tickling on your head. 
It's KG with the feather and the French tickler, 
Look out baby he got the tools. 
And then you feel sumpin' down by your feet. 
It's me, it's JB, I'm suckin' upon your toes. 

We don't mind sucking on toes! 
Good luck finding a boyfriend who sucks toe, ow! 
Havin' sex with me and KG, 
Now you're talkin' double team supreme. 

Let's roll! 
Oh! 
[2-part:] Ahh, oh! 

What! Yeah! Huh! Nah! Oh! 
Ah, that's it, that's right, ohmygah, oh-I-think-I'm-gonna, Ohh! 
Deht! Deht! Eeee! 
...Splooge! 

[spoken] 
That was the one. 

[KG:] Hail Satan! 
[JB:] Hail Satan! 
[KG:] Hail Satan! 
[JB:] Hail Satan!
