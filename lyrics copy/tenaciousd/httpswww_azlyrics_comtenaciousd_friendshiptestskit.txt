[JB:] I said I love you, man. I just wanted to say it. 
[KG:] Dude, thanks... thank you... that's awesome. Fuckin' awesome. I mean, uh... that's cool you can say that. 
[JB:] Don't you have something to say? 
[KG:] No. (pause) Aw, I mean, I, uh, I like you... I like you too, dude. 
[JB:] Whoa, whoa. LIKE? HO HO HO, MAN! I'm glad I fuckin' did this test on you, the friendship test! 
[KG:] What? 
[JB:] No, man-- 
[KG:] What are you talkin' about? 
[JB:] That---what happened before when I said I love you, that was a test. 
Because, man, I could've made a total ASS of myself if I hadn't done this test on you.
