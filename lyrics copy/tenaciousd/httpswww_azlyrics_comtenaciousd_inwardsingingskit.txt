Inward Singing (Skit)


{Oh my God! Oh my God, I've done it
Kage! Come here, I want you!
What? What? God! I was sleeping, dude!
What are you talking about}

{Oh my God
What?
I did it
What d'ya do?
I've done it. I fuckin' did it.
The most powerful tool in singing technology since yodeling, dude}

{Oh my God, inward singing
What?
Check it out, it's an invention
And it makes non-stop rocking possible}

{Think about it, man!
Rock singers are only rocking you half the time!
The other time they're they're they're they're breathing! In!
But not anymore, baby!
Not with inward singing, check it out!}

And then I start some lyrics and you can't believe I'm singing
And I'm never fucking stopping
And I'm always fucking singing
And now you know that I will never stop the fucking singing
I'm like a fucking one-man band
I'm like a fucking one-man band!

{And I can sing like that all fucking night!
Wow}

{It wasn't really non-stop though, there was a slight
Shut up! It is non-stop!
And the other thing is, that when I'm fuckin' singing in
It sounds even better!
Than when I'm singing out!}

{Shut up! Fuck you! You fucking dick!
Always nay-saying everything I create! You piece of shit!
You create something like inward singing! You fucking shit!
You fucking sit in your tower! Fucking nap
What's funny? You fucking bitch! Fucking fuck you!
Fucking cock ass!!}

{You are fired from the band
Well that won't be necessary Jack
Why? well I am quitting
What? I quit}
