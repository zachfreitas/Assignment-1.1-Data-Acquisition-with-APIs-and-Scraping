Lee, Lee, Lee, Lee, 
Lee Lee Lee Lee Lee Lee Lee Lee Lee, 
We're talkin' fuckin' Lee. 
I had a friend named Lee, 
He cast a spell a spell on me. 
If me and Lee and KG could be three, 
Flyin' free Tenaciously, 
Skinny-dippin' in a sea of Lee, 
I'd propose on bended knee 
To Lee Lee Lee, Lee Lee Lee, 
Lee Lee, 
Lee Lee Lee, Lee Lee Lee, 
Lee Lee, 
Le-Lut-Le-Le-Le-Lee Lee Lee, 
Le-Lut-Le-Le-Le-Lee Lee, 
If me, and Lee, and KG, (that's me)
Could be three, (could be three)
Plant a tree, (plant a tree)
Just for Lee, (just for Lee)
Just for Lee, (Lee)
Just for Lee! 
Lee, Lee, Lee: ["Psycho" Knife Song style, 16X]
Leeee, Leeee, Leeee: 
LEE!
