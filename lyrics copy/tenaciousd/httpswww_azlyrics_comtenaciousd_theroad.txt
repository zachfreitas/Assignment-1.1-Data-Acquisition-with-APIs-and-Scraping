The Road


The road is fuckin' hard, 
The road is fuckin' tough-ah, 
There's no question that-eh 
It is rough, rough stuff. 
It's the fuckin' road my friend 
But it's the only road I know. 
When I'm lunchin' on a tasty boosh 
Right after the show. 
You g-go go go! 

The road is fuckin' hard, 
It's also really fuckin' tough, 
There's no question that 
It don't take no guff. 
The road is a be-a-itch my friend 
But it's the only fuckin' road I know, 
When I'm snackin' on a tasty boosh 
Right after the show. 
You g-go go go! 

I met a tasty baby in Michigan. 
We screwed two times then I left. 
Sometimes I think of my baby in Michigan. 
Why can't I stay in one place 
For more than two days. 
Why?! 
Because I'm talkin' about the road. [5X]
Road!
